An implementation of the graph-based supervoxel methods. This 
code implements the general streaming algorithm in our 
ECCV 2012 paper. It implements a superset of
	1. Streaming GBH
	2. GBH
	3. Streaming GB
	4. GB
The variant is selected based on the parameters settings given on 
the command line.

Example use:   
	1) Type "make" to compile the program
	2) Run "./gbh_stream c c_reg min sigma range hie_num out_col input output"

	The first four parameters are grouping parameters per the algorithm. 
	The next two parameters govern the variant of the method. The final 
	two parameters are the input and output paths. The output path will 
	be created and overwritten if it exists already.

	Parameters in order are:
		c -- Governs the merging threshold of two nodes in the minimum 
			spanning tree during the oversegmentation stage. Bigger c 
			means larger segments.

		c_reg -- Like c, it governs the merging of two nodes, but this 
			is in the hierarchical levels whereas c is at the pixel 
			level nodes.

		min -- Enforced minimum segment size (for a whole supervoxel).
        
        ** These first three are sensitive to the length of one
		subsequence (or clip). If the range (number of frames in one 
		subsequence) goes up, you may set larger values for these three 
		parameters.

		sigma -- The variance of the Gaussian smoothing. 

		range -- The number of frames to include in one subsequence (or 
			clip). range = 1 means each frame is handled separately. 
			range = NUMBER_OF_FRAMES means the whole video is handled 
			at once (beware of memory need). range = k is the typical 
			way to run the streaming method; our paper shows the larger 
			the range, the "better" the results.

      	hie_num -- The number of desired levels in the hierarchy + 1. 
        	If hie_num = 0, no hierarchy is created.

		out_col -- Determines the format of the output ppm frames.
			If out_col = 0, each segment is a random color.
			If out_col = 1, segments are incrementally changed colors.
			Random is visually easier and segment colors propogate
			through hierarchies.  Incremental is robust and ensures
			uniqueness in segment coloring per hierarchy.

	You need to use ffmpeg first to turn the video into ppm frames 
	starting from "00001.ppm".
		E.g.,  ffmpeg -i video.mpg input/%05d.ppm

 A Note On the Parameters.
    Choosing the proper parameters is important in generating sensible 
	results. Here, we provide some more guidelines on suitable ranges 
	for the parameters.
	
	A typical setting for a 320x240 video k = 10 streaming:
	./gbh_stream 5 200 100 0.5 10 20 0 input/path output/path

	You are welcome to contact the authors if you have came out a 
	good parameter setting.
