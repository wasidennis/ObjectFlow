An implementation of the graph-based supervoxel methods.
It implements a superset of
	1. GBH
	2. GB
The variant is selected based on the parameters settings given on 
the command line.

Example use:   
	1) Type "make" to compile the program
	2) Run "./gbh c c_reg min sigma hie_num input output"

	Parameters in order are:
		c -- Governs the merging threshold of two nodes in the minimum 
			spanning tree during the oversegmentation stage. Bigger c 
			means larger segments.

		c_reg -- Like c, it governs the merging of two nodes, but this 
			is in the hierarchical levels whereas c is at the pixel 
			level nodes.

		min -- Enforced minimum segment size (for a whole supervoxel).
        
        ** These first three are sensitive to the length of a video.
		If the video length (number of frames) goes up, you may set 
		larger values for these three parameters.

		sigma -- The variance of the Gaussian smoothing. 

      	hie_num -- The number of desired levels in the hierarchy + 1. 
        	If hie_num = 0, no hierarchy is created, which is GB.

	The first four parameters are grouping parameters per the algorithm. 
	The next parameter governs the variant of the method. The final 
	two parameters are the input and output paths. The output path will 
	be created and overwritten if it exists already.

	You need to use ffmpeg first to turn the video into ppm frames 
	starting from "00001.ppm".
		E.g.,  ffmpeg -i video.mpg input/%05d.ppm

 A Note On the Parameters.
    Choosing the right parameters is important in generating sensible 
	results. Here, we provide some more guidelines on suitable ranges 
	for the parameters.
	
	A typical setting for a 320x240 video (10 frames):
	./gbh 5 200 100 0.5 20 0 input/path output/path

	You are welcome to contact the authors if you have came out a good 
	parameter setting.
